# Bracketology-with-Google-Machine-Learning


BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without managing infrastructure or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and takes advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.

BigQuery ML allows data analysts to use their SQL knowledge to build machine learning models quickly right where their data already lives in BigQuery.

In BigQuery, there is a publicly available dataset for NCAA basketball games, teams, and players. The game data covers play-by-play and box scores back to 2009, as well as final scores back to 1996. Additional data about wins and losses goes back to the 1894-5 season in some teams' cases.

In this lab, you use BigQuery ML to prototype, train, evaluate, and predict the 'winners' and 'losers' between two NCAA basketball tournament teams.

What you'll do
In this lab, you will learn how to:

Use BigQuery to access the public NCAA dataset
Explore the NCAA dataset to gain familiarity with the schema and scope of the data available
Prepare and transform the existing data into features and labels
Split the dataset into training and evaluation subsets
Use BigQuery ML to build a model based on the NCAA tournament dataset
Use your newly created model to predict NCAA tournament winners for your bracket
